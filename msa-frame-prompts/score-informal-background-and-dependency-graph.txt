You are given a scenario. The following text contains the scenario, along with an explanation of the underlying causal factors necessary to answer the questions.
Is this explanation accurate according to your commonsense knowledge and reflective of the concepts in the scenario? Please also make sure that the abstract concept dependency graph contains the abstract concepts mentioned in the explanation IN ORDER so that concepts are defined before any others that DEPEND on them. For instance, the concept that a player tried hard in a match should come before the concept of whether an individual athlete (or team) won or lost. The concept dependency graph doesn't need to include all details from the explanation, but it should include key dependencies (e.g., if the explanation says that athletes that had a bad night sleep don't run as fast, then the concept of running_time should depend on bad_night_sleep).
Assign a rating on a scale of 0-10, where 0=worst possible explanation and concept dependency ordering -- and 10=best possible explanation and concept dependency ordering. If any concepts are out of order, or key releationships in the causal factors are missing from the explanations and/or dependencies, assign a low score. Err on the side of harsher (lower) scores.Explanation and concept dependency graph:
