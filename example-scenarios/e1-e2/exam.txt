<START_SCENARIO>
BACKGROUND
In this model, students are being evaluated for their science class, which has a two part exam that combines their performance on a written exam and a laboratory portion. These exams are completed in pairs, so sets of students collectively take evaluations.

On each evaluation, the students will first take a written exam, which tests their intrinsic memorization abilities, and then are evaluated on a live laboratory portion. The live laboratory portion is notoriously finicky and performance is somewhat up to chance. 

Their scores are based on the percentage of written exam questions they get correctly and how well they do on any given lab. Note that their intrinsic memorization abilities remain constant throughout all of their exams -- they neither get better nor worse at memorization across rounds.

Any pair of student's overall performance on any given evaluation is determined by the combined scores for each student on both the written and laboratory portion. The written and lab portions are weighted equally. 

CONDITIONS
In the first evaluation, Barbara and Ajax passed.
In the second evaluation, Barbara and Lou failed.
In the third evaluation, Barbara and Casey passed.
In the fourth evaluation, Lou and Casey passed.

QUERIES
Query 1: Out of 100 random students, where do you think Barbara ranks in terms of intrinsic memorization ability? 
Query 2: Out of 100 random students, where do you think Lou ranks in terms of intrinsic memorization ability?
Query 3: Out of 100 random students, where do you think Casey ranks in terms of intrinsic memorization ability?
Query 4: On a percentage scale from 0 to 100%, how well do you think Barbara performed on the laboratory portion in the second evaluation?
Query 5: On a percentage scale from 0 to 100%, how well do you think Lou performed on the laboratory portion in the second evaluation?
Query 6: On a percentage scale from 0 to 100%, how well do you think Casey performed on the laboratory portion in the fourth evaluation?
Query 7: In a new evaluation later this same day, who do you think would do better, Barbara and Lou (Pair 1) or Casey and Ajax (Pair 2), and by how much?

<START_SCRATCHPAD>
Intrinsic memorization ability is an underlying, constant factor about a given student, and this varies a lot between students -- in general, students can have poor, middling,  strong memorization abilities.

A student's intrinsic memorization ranking out of n other students is the number of other students we might expect them to be stronger than out of N total random students.

A student's laboratory performance varies from evaluation to evaluation. A student who is intrinsically good at memorization may have a very good live laboratory performance, very bad performance, or something in between. How they do is somewhat down to chance, and the description also says that performance is finicky. There's probably SOME relationship between memorization and live laboratory performance, because strong students are proabably more experienced in the class and weaker students probably will mess up on lots of given exams.

How well someone does on the lab on average if they have low, moderate, or very good performance.

An student's written exam performance in a given evaluation is some transformation on top of their  memorization ability.

A student pair's overall score in an evaluation is the sum of their average performance on the written exam, plus their average performance on the live lab, in that particular evaluation.

A student pair passes an evaluation if they get higher than a passing score in that evaluation.

A student pair fails if they didn't pass the evaluation.
