You will answer each query by providing 5 numbers,each on a scale of 0-100 for that query. 

Provide your response to all questions in the form: 

{"query1": [RESPONSE1, RESPONSE2... RESPONSE5], 
"query2": [RESPONSE1, RESPONSE2... RESPONSE5], 
"query3": [RESPONSE1, RESPONSE2... RESPONSE5], 
"query4": [RESPONSE1, RESPONSE2... RESPONSE5], 
"query5": [RESPONSE1, RESPONSE2... RESPONSE5], 
"query6": [RESPONSE1, RESPONSE2... RESPONSE5], 
"query7": [RESPONSE1, RESPONSE2... RESPONSE5], 
"query8": [RESPONSE1, RESPONSE2... RESPONSE5]}

Each response MUST be a number between 0-100.

Interpret each query as if answering on the
