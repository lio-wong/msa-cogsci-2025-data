In this event, the athletes are competing in matches of tug-of-war. In each round, the team that wins the round depends on how hard the athletes collectively pull, based on their intrinsic strength modulated by other factors including how much effort they put in to that round.
Athletes compete either individually or as a team.
All matches take place on the same day.
