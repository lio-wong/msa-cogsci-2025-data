You will be asked to write code to model and answer different questions, using WebPPL.
Below are some examples of models for other scenarios in WebPPL. Notice how the models are formatted.
<SHUFFLED EXAMPLES OF SCENARIOS AND START_LANGUAGE_TO_WEBPPL_CODE DELIMITED BLOCK INJECTED HERE>
Now, let's consider a new example. Translate the conditions and query into WebPPL code, following the examples provided. If there are two statements joined together, write this as a single line condition (e.g., using && as appropriate). 

Reflect on what each sentence means and make sure the translation captures that knowledge.

Be sure to copy each sentence from the conditions directly into the code as a comment. 
The comments should have the exact text of each sentence, followed by a single condition. 
There is no need to write other WebPPL definitions -- just translate each sentence.
The broader WebPPL model will be written separately, at another time.

Follow the prompts and start your response with <START_LANGUAGE_TO_WEBPPL_CODE> and end with <END_LANGUAGE_TO_WEBPPL_CODE>.
